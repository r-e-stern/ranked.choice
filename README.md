# ranked.choice

**ranked.choice** is a ranked-choice voting ajudicator written for Berkeley High School ranked-choice elections. It's written in JavaScript ES6 and uses [PapaParse 5](https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse).

## How to use

Simply input a full list of eligible candidates, separated by tabs or commas, into the Candidates box, a full list of new-line separated ballots in which the individual choices are separated by tabs or commas, and press **Run election**. If you're using the BHS Google Form ballot infrastructure, you should be able to copy/paste directly from the returns spreadsheet.
